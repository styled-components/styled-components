# `styled-components` Core Team

The `styled-components` Core Team is a group of `styled-components` contributors that have demonstrated a lasting enthusiasm for the project and community. The Core Team has [GitHub admin privileges](https://github.com/orgs/styled-components/teams/core) on all `styled-components` repos.

## Core Team Responsibilities

The `styled-components` Core Team has the following responsibilities:

- Being available to answer high-level questions about `styled-components`'s vision and future.
- Being available to review longstanding/forgotten pull requests.
- Occasionally check `styled-components` issues, offer input, and categorize with GitHub issue labels.
- Looking out for up-and-coming members of the `styled-components` community who might want to serve as Core Team members.
- Pushing new releases of the package to `npm`.

Note that the `styled-components` Core Team – and all `styled-components` contributors – are open source _volunteers_; membership on the Core Team is expressly _not_ an obligation. The Core Team is distinguished as leaders in the community and while they are a good group to turn to when someone needs an answer to a question, they are still volunteering their time, and may not be available to help immediately.

## Core Team Members

The current core team members, ordered first by status and then time of addition:

| @geelen     | inactive |
| @mxstbr     | inactive |
| @philpl     | inactive |
| @schwers    | inactive |
| @imbhargav5 | inactive |

We are seeking helping hands for the future of styled-components! If interested, please shoot [@quantizor](https://x.com/quantizor) a message on X.

## Adding new Core Team Members

The process for adding new Core Team members is as follows:

- An existing Core Team member reaches out privately to see if the individual is interested. If they are, open a pull request adding them to the list.
- Existing Core Team members review the pull request. The person merging the PR is responsible for adding them to the ["Core" GitHub team](https://github.com/orgs/styled-components/teams/core) and for adding them as an owner to the npm package. (`npm owner add <npmusername>`)

> Note: If you feel like you have demonstrated a lasting enthusiasm for the `styled-components` project and community, yet nobody has reached out to you about joining the core team, feel free to ping one of the existing core team members _privately_ about the possibility of joining the core team.
