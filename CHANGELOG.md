# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. If a contribution does not have a mention next to it, [@geelen](https://github.com/geelen) or [@mxstbr](https://github.com/mxstbr) did it.

_The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/)._

## Unreleased

- Use `class` instead of `className` for unidentified DOM elements (better support for styling web components)

- Upgrade to stylis v4

- Rename `masterSheet` in internals to `mainSheet`

## [v5.3.0] - 2021-05-04

- Pass `elementToBeCreated` as a third parameter to `shouldForwardProp` so that the user-specified function can decide whether to pass through props based on whether the created element will be a tag or another component. (see [#3436](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/3436))

- Fix React Native components accepts function as style prop. (see [#3389](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/3389))

## [v5.2.2] - 2021-03-30

- For React Native based components, pass `testID` down to the native component if specified for an easier time testing. (see [#3365](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/3365))

- Enable users of the babel macro to customize the styled-components import with `importModuleName` (see [#3422](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/3422))

- [fix] COMPLEX_SELECTOR_PREFIX.includes wasn't transpiled (see [#3397](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/3397))

## [v5.2.1] - 2020-10-30

- Tweak server-side build settings to resolve an issue with jest-dom not being able to pick up generated styles (see [#3308](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/3308)) thanks @Lazyuki

## [v5.2.0] - 2020-09-04

- Make sure `StyleSheetManager` renders all styles in iframe / child windows (see [#3159](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/3159)) thanks @eramdam!

- Rework how components self-reference in extension scenarios (see [#3236](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/3236)); should fix a bunch of subtle bugs around patterns like `& + &`

- Fix `keyframes` not receiving a modified stylis instance when using something like `stylis-plugin-rtl` (see [#3239](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/3239))

- Big performance gain for components using [style objects](https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced#style-objects) (see [#3239](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/3239))

- We no longer emit dynamic classNames for empty rulesets, so some className churn may occur in snapshots

- Preallocate global style placement to ensure cGS is consistently inserted at the top of the stylesheet; note that this is done in _runtime order_ so, if you have multiple cGS that have overlapping styles, ensure they're defined in code in the sequence you would want them injected (see [#3239](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/3239))

- Add "engines" to package.json (currently set to Node 10, the oldest supported LTS distribution) (see [#3201](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/3201)) thanks @MichaelDeBoey!

- Allow `DISABLE_SPEEDY` to be set to `false` to enable speedy mode in non-production environments (see [#3289](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/3289)) thanks @FastFedora!

- Enable new style rules can be inserted in the middle of existing sheet when rendering on client after rehydrate. `GroupIDAllocator` is now changed to find `nextFreeGroup` by checking `reverseRegister`, instead of setting it to the end of existing groups. (see [#3233](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/3233)) thanks @mu29!

## [v5.1.1] - 2020-04-07

### New Functionality

- Implement `shouldForwardProp` API for native and primitive platforms, which was previously missing in [v5.1.0] (see [#3093](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/3107))
  This has been released under a patch bump instead of a minor, since it's only been missing from Native-support.

### Bugfixes

- Added `useTheme` hook to named exports for react-primitives entrypoint (see [#2982](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2982)) thanks @jladuval!
- Escape every CSS ident character necessary when converting component display names to class names (see [#3102](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/3102)) thanks @kripod!

## [v5.1.0] - 2020-04-07

### New Functionality

- Add `shouldForwardProp` API (almost the same as emotion's, just a slightly different usage pattern); https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/3006

  Sometimes when composing multiple higher-order components together, it's possible to get into scenarios when multiple layers consume props by the same name. In the past we've introduced various workarounds for popular props like `"as"` but this power-user API allows for more granular customization of what props are passed down to descendant component children when using the `styled()` HOC wrapper.

  When combined with other APIs like `.attrs()` this becomes a very powerful constellation of abilities.

  Here's how you use it:

  ```jsx
  const Comp = styled('div').withConfig({
    shouldForwardProp: (prop, defaultValidatorFn) => !['filterThis'].includes(prop),
  })`
    color: red;
  `;

  render(<Comp filterThis="abc" passThru="def" />);

  # Renders: <div className="[generated]" passThru="def"></div>
  ```

  The second argument `defaultValidatorFn` is what we use internally to validate props based on known HTML attributes. It's provided so you can filter exactly what props you don't wish to pass and then fall-back to the default filtering mechanism if desired.

  Other methods on the `styled` HOC like `.attrs` can be chained after `withConfig()`, and before opening your template literal:

  ```jsx
  const Comp = styled('div').withConfig({
    shouldForwardProp: (prop, defaultValidatorFn) => !['filterThis'].includes(prop),
  }).attrs({ className: 'foo' })`
    color: red;
  `;

  render(<Comp filterThis="abc" passThru="def" />);

  # Renders: <div className="[generated] foo" passThru="def"></div>
  ```

  Thanks @stevesims and all that contributed!

- Add "transient props" API; https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/3052

  Think of [_transient props_](https://medium.com/@probablyup/introducing-transient-props-f35fd5203e0c) as a lightweight, but complementary API to `shouldForwardProp`. Because styled-components allows any kind of prop to be used for styling (a trait shared by most CSS-in-JS libraries, but not the third party library ecosystem in general), adding a filter for every possible prop you might use can get cumbersome.

  _Transient props_ are a new pattern to pass props that are explicitly consumed only by styled components and are not meant to be passed down to deeper component layers. Here's how you use them:

  ```jsx
  const Comp = styled.div`
    color: ${props => props.$fg || 'black'};
  `;

  render(<Comp $fg="red">I'm red!</Comp>);
  ```

  Note the dollar sign (`$`) prefix on the prop; this marks it as _transient_ and styled-components knows not to add it to the rendered DOM element or pass it further down the component hierarchy.

### Bugfixes

- Fix slow SSR Rehydration for malformed CSS and increase fault-tolerance (see [#3018](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/3018))

- Change isPlainObject (internal method) to support objects created in a different context (see [#3068](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/3068)) thanks @keeganstreet!

- Add support for the `<video disablePictureInPicture>` (see [#3058](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/3058)) thanks @egdbear!

## [v5.0.1] - 2020-02-04

- Added useTheme hook to named exports for react native

- Performance enhancements

  - Refactored hashing function that is a bit faster in benchmarks
  - Fixed a bitwise math issue that was causing SSR performance degradations due to how we allocate typed arrays under the hood

- Added some helpful new dev-time warnings for antipatterns
  - Recommending against usage of css `@import` inside `createGlobalStyle` and what to do instead
  - Catching and warning against dynamic creation of styled-components inside other component render paths

## [v5.0.0] - 2020-01-13

Read the [v5 release announcement](https://medium.com/styled-components/announcing-styled-components-v5-beast-mode-389747abd987)!

- 19% smaller bundle size
- 18% faster client-side mounting
- 17% faster updating of dynamic styles
- 45% faster server-side rendering
- RTL support

**NOTE: At this time we recommend not using `@import` inside of `createGlobalStyle`. We're working on better behavior for this functionality but it just doesn't really work at the moment and it's better if you just embed these imports in your HTML index file, etc.**

- `StyleSheetManager` enhancements
  - you can now supply stylis plugins like [stylis-plugin-rtl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylis-plugin-rtl); `<StyleSheetManager stylisPlugins={[]}>...</StyleSheetManager>`
  - `disableVendorPrefixes` removes autoprefixing if you don't need legacy browser support; `<StyleSheetManager disableVendorPrefixes>...</StyleSheetManager>`
  - `disableCSSOMInjection` forces using the slower injection mode if other integrations in your runtime environment can't parse CSSOM-injected styles; `<StyleSheetManager disableCSSOMInjection>...</StyleSheetManager>`

* **Remove deprecated attrs "subfunction" syntax variant**

  ```js
  styled.div.attrs({ color: p => p.color });
  ```

  should become

  ```js
  styled.div.attrs(p => ({ color: p.color }));
  ```

  You can still pass objects to `attrs` but individual properties shouldn't have functions that receive props anymore.

* Fix attrs not taking precedence over props when overriding a given prop

* (ReactNative) upgrade css-to-react-native to v3 ([changelog](https://github.com/styled-components/css-to-react-native/releases/tag/v3.0.0))

  - Removed support for unitless line height in font shorthand

* Replace `merge-anything` with `mixin-deep` to save some bytes (this is what handles merging of `defaultProps` between folded styled components); this is inlined into since the library is written in IE-incompatible syntax

* Fix certain adblockers messing up styling by purposefully not emitting the substring "ad" (case-insensitive) when generating dynamic class names

* Fix regressed behavior between v3 and v4 where className was not correctly aggregated between folded `.attrs` invocations

- Fix support for styling custom elements (https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2819)

## [v4.4.1] - 2019-10-30

- Fix `styled-components`'s `react-native` import for React Native Web, by [@fiberjw](https://github.com/fiberjw) (see [#2797](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2797))

- Remove dev-time warning if referencing a theme prop without an outer `ThemeProvider`, the check for it isn't smart enough to handle cases with "or" or ternary fallbacks and creates undesirable noise in various third party integrations

## [v4.4.0] - 2019-09-23

- Fix to use `ownerDocument` instead of global `document`, by [@yamachig](https://github.com/yamachig) (see [#2721](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2721))

- Backport fix for SSR classname mismatches in development mode for some environments like next.js (see [#2701](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2701))

- Fix attrs not properly taking precedence over props

- Backport fix where classnames are composed in the wrong order if custom class names are passed in (see [#2760](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2760))

- Fix add check for style tag detached - sheet in the style tag is null in this case, by [@newying61](https://github.com/newying61) (see [#2707](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2707))

## [v4.3.2] - 2019-06-19

- Fix usage of the "css" prop with the styled-components babel macro (relevant to CRA 2.x users), by [@jamesknelson](http://github.com/jamesknelson) (see [#2633](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/issues/2633))

## [v4.3.1] - 2019-06-06

- Revert #2586; breaks rehydration in dev for certain runtimes like next.js

## [v4.3.0] - 2019-06-05

- Make it possible to initialize `SC_ATTR` and `SC_DISABLE_SPEEDY` via `REACT_APP_*` .env variables for easier integration with CRA applications (see [#2501](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2501))

- Fix `theme` prop for styled native components, also fixes `theme` in
  `defaultProps` for them.

- Add "forwardedAs" prop to allow deeply passing a different "as" prop value to underlying components
  when using `styled()` as a higher-order component

- Implement defaultProps folding (see [#2597](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/issues/2597))

## [v4.2.1] - 2019-05-30

- Remove className usage checker dev utility due to excessive false-positive noise in certain runtime environments like next.js and the related warning suppression prop (see [#2563](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/issues/2563)).

- Attach displayName to forwardRef function as described in React docs (see [#2508](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/issues/2508)).

- Compatibility with react-native-web 0.11 (see [#2453](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/issues/2453)).

- Add stack trace to .attrs warning (see [#2486](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/issues/2486)).

- Fix functions as values for object literals. (see [2489](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2489))

- Remove validation in Babel macro, by [@mAAdhaTTah](http://github.com/mAAdhaTTah) (see [#2427](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2427))

## [v4.2.0] - 2019-03-23

- Reduced GC pressure when using component selector styles. (see [#2424](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/issues/2424)).

- Add svg tag `marker` to domElements.js (see [#2389](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2389))

- Make the `GlobalStyleComponent` created by `createGlobalStyle` call the base constructor with `props` (see [#2321](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2321)).

- Move to Mono repository structure with lerna [@imbhargav5](https://github.com/imbhargav5) (see [#2326](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2326))

- Expose `StyleSheetContext` and `StyleSheetConsumer` for you fancy babes doing wild stuff

- Filter `suppressClassNameWarning` to not to pass down to the wrapped components [@taneba](https://github.com/taneba) (see [#2365](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2365))

- Fix an edge case where React would break streaming inside `<textarea>` elements, which have special child behavior and aren't a suitable place to inject a style tag (see [#2413](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2413))

## [v4.1.3] - 2018-12-17

- Under the hood code cleanup of the Babel macro, by [@lucleray](https://github.com/lucleray) (see [#2286](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2286))

## [v4.1.2] - 2018-11-28

- Fix function-form attrs to receive the full execution context (including theme) (see [#2210](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2210))

- Adjust `innerRef` deprecation warning to not be fired if wrapping a custom component, since that underlying component may not be on forwardRef yet and actually using the prop (see [#2211](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2211))

- Expose the `ThemeConsumer` and `ThemeContext` exports for the native and primitives entries (see [#2217](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2217))

- Remove `createGlobalStyle` multimount warning; Concurrent and Strict modes intentionally render the same component multiple times, which causes this warning to be triggered always even when usage is correct in the application (see [#2216](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2216))

- Folded components are now targettable via component selector as in v3 if you used the old `.extend` API (see [#2239](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2239))

- Don't treat uppercased strings as tag-like components and don't filter out props from them (see [#2225](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2225))

## [v4.1.1] - 2018-11-12

- Put back the try/catch guard around a part of the flattener that sometimes receives undetectable SFCs (fixes an errand hard error in an edge case)

## [v4.1.0] - 2018-11-12

- Performance optimization for fully static (no function interpolation) styled-components by avoiding using `ThemeConsumer` since it isn't necessary, by [@mxstbr](https://github.com/mxstbr) (see [#2166](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2166))

- Allow disabling "speedy" mode via global `SC_DISABLE_SPEEDY` variable, by [@devrelm](https://github.com/devrelm) (see [#2185](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2185))

  To make use of this, you can either set `SC_DISABLE_SPEEDY` in your app's entry file or use something like `webpack.DefinePlugin` to do it at build time:

  ```js
  webpack.DefinePlugin({
    SC_DISABLE_SPEEDY: true,
  });
  ```

- Attrs can now be passed a function (see [#2200](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2200)); thanks [@oliverlaz](https://github.com/oliverlaz) for providing an early PoC PR for this!

  e.g.:

  ```js
  styled.div.attrs(props => ({ 'aria-title': props.title }))``;
  ```

- Fix the `warnTooManyClasses` dev helper not being totally dead code eliminated in production (see [#2200](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2200))

- Deprecate functions as object keys for object-form attrs (see [#2200](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2200))

  e.g.:

  ```js
  styled.div.attrs({ 'aria-title': props => props.title })``; // bad
  styled.div.attrs(props => ({ 'aria-title': props.title }))``; // good
  ```

  Support for this will be removed in styled-components v5. The primary impetus behind this change is to eliminate confusion around basic functions vs styled-components vs React components provided as values in the object-form attrs constructor, each of which has different handling behaviors. The single outer function to receive the props and then return a props object is conceptually simpler.

- The standalone CDN build is now UMD-compliant and can be used with RequireJS, etc.

- Add pixels to unitless numbers when object interpolation is used, by [@Fer0x](https://github.com/Fer0x) (see [#2173](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2173))

- Trying to interpolate a non-styled component into CSS is now a hard error, rather than a warning (see [#2173](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2173))

## [v4.0.3] - 2018-10-30

- Interpolating a styled component into a string now returns the static component selector (emotion cross-compat)

  ```js
  import styled from 'styled-components';

  const Comp = styled.div`
    color: red;
  `;

  `${Comp}`; // .sc-hash
  ```

- Add `suppressClassNameWarning` prop to disable warning when wrapping a React component with `styled()` and the `className` isn't used, by [@Fer0x](https://github.com/Fer0x) (see [#2156](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2156))

- Expose ThemeContext to enable static contextType support for React 16.6, by [@imbhargav5](https://github.com/imbhargav5) (see [#2152](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2152))

- Filter out invalid HTML attributes from `attrs`, by [@Fer0x](https://github.com/Fer0x) (see [#2133](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2133))

- Add warning if an `attrs` prop is a function that returns an element, by [@timswalling](https://github.com/timswalling) (see [#2162](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2162))

## [v4.0.2] - 2018-10-18

- Handle an edge case where an at-rule was being supplied to the self-reference stylis plugin at an incorrect context setting, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup) (see [#2114](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2114))

## [v4.0.1] - 2018-10-17

- Add suppressMultiMountWarning prop to disable warning on multiple cgs mount, by [@imbhargav5](https://github.com/imbhargav5) (see [#2107](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2107))

- Fix self-reference replacement edge cases, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup) (see [#2109](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2109))

## [v4.0.0] - 2018-10-15

This is a rollup of the highlights of beta 0-11 for convenience. See the [migration guide](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/faqs#what-do-i-need-to-do-to-migrate-to-v4) for easy updating steps and the [beta announcement blog](https://medium.com/styled-components/announcing-styled-components-v4-better-faster-stronger-3fe1aba1a112) for our summary of v4's changes, thought process, etc.

### New stuff

- Add babel macro for full-featured interop with create react app v2+, by [@lucleray](https://github.com/lucleray) (see [#2032](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2032))

- Expose `ThemeConsumer` component, context consumer render prop component from the `React.createContext` API if people are interested in using it rather than / in addition to the `withTheme` HOC, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup)

- Add `createGlobalStyle` that returns a component which, when mounting, will apply global styles. This is a replacement for the `injectGlobal` API. It can be updated, replaced, removed, etc like any normal component and the global scope will update accordingly, by [@JamieDixon](https://github.com/JamieDixon) [@marionebl](https://github.com/marionebl), [@yjimk](https://github.com/yjimk), and [@imbhargav5](https://github.com/imbhargav5) (see [#1416](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1416))

  ```jsx
  const GlobalStyles = createGlobalStyle`
    html {
      color: 'red';
    }
  `;

  // then put it in your React tree somewhere:
  // <GlobalStyles />
  ```

- Added a first-class API for rendering polymorphism via "as" prop. In most cases, this new prop will replace your need to use the `.withComponent` API. It allows you to control what underlying element or component is rendered at runtime, while not messing with the styles, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup) (see [#1962](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1962))

  ```jsx
  import { Link } from 'react-router'

  const Component = styled.div`
    color: red;
  `

  // Examples
  <Component>Hello world!</Component>
  <Component as="span">Hello world!</Component>
  <Component as={Link} to="home">Hello world!</Component>
  ```

### Breaking changes

- Fix how ampersand is handled in self-referential selector combinations, e.g. `& + &` (see [#2071](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2071))

- Remove deprecated `consolidateStreamedStyles` API, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup) (see [#1906](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1906))

- Remove deprecated `jsnext:main` entry point from package.json, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup) (see [#1907](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1907))

- Remove deprecated `.extend` API, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup) (see [#1908](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1908))

- Migrate to new context API, by [@alexandernanberg](https://github.com/alexandernanberg) (see [#1894](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1894))

- Remove TS typings; they are now to be found in DefinitelyTyped, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup). See https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/issues/1778 for more information.

- Add new `data-styled-version` attribute to generated `<style>` tags to allow multiple versions of styled-components to function on the page at once without clobbering each other, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup)

  It's still highly recommended to use aliasing via your bundler to dedupe libraries like styled-components and react.

- [Breaking change] Refactor `keyframes` helper, by [@fer0x](https://github.com/Fer0x) (see [#1930](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1930)).

  Keyframes is now implemented in a "lazy" manner: its styles will be injected with the render phase of components using them.

  `keyframes` no longer returns an animation name, instead it returns an object which has method `.getName()` for the purpose of getting the animation name.

- Migrate to use new `React.forwardRef` API, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup); note that this removes the `innerRef` API since it is no longer needed.

- Implement `styled()` wrapper folding. In a nutshell, when you nest styled wrappers (e.g. `styled(styled.div)`) the components are now folded such that only one is mounted that contains the merged styles of its ancestors. This is conceptually equivalent to the removed "extend" functionality, but without many of the downsides -- and it's automatic, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup) (see [#1962](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1962))

### Developer experience improvements

- Add warning when component is not a styled component and cannot be referred via component selector, by [@egdbear](https://github.com/egdbear) (see [#2070](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2070))

  When using CRA v2, import styled components from `styled-components/macro` instead to gain all the benefits of [our babel plugin](https://github.com/styled-components/babel-plugin-styled-components).

- Add a warning when wrapping a React component with `styled()` and the `className` isn't used (meaning styling isn't applied), by [@Fer0x](https://github.com/Fer0x) (see [#2073](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2073))

- Tweak the styled components base component naming to look nicer in DevTools, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup) (see [#2012](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2012))

- Beef up the error message that sometimes occurs when multiple versions of styled components are used together and the StyleSheet instance can't be found, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup) (see [#2012](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2012))

### Misc

- Add `enzymeFind` test utility to easily grab instances of a styled-component from enyzme mounted testing scenarios, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup) (see [#2049](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2049))

  ```js
  import { mount } from 'enzyme';
  import React from 'react';
  import styled from 'styled-components';

- Fix `withTheme` HOC to use a theme defined in `defaultProps` of the wrapped component, by [@theboyWhoCriedWoolf](https://github.com/theboyWhoCriedWoolf) (see [#2033](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2033))

- Add `enzymeFind` test utility to easily grab instances of a styled-component from enyzme mounted testing scenarios, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup) (see [#2049](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2049))

```js
import { mount } from 'enzyme';
import React from 'react';

## [v4.0.0-beta.7] - 2018-09-18

## [v4.0.0-beta.6] - 2018-09-17

- Fix a bug introduced from some refactoring that went into beta.5 around usage of `keyframes` with multiple interpolations, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup) (see [#2013](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2013))

- Fix the `createGlobalStyle` multiusage warning having false positives, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup) (see [#1993](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1993))

## [v4.0.0-beta.2] - 2018-09-09

- Expose `ThemeConsumer` component, context consumer render prop component from the `React.createContext` API if people are interested in using it rather than / in addition to the `withTheme` HOC, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup)

- Remove "no tags" experiment, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup) (see [#1987](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1987))

- Fixed an issue with `createGlobalStyle` when the component was composed in multiple places and render of the subsequent component instance happened before unmount of the original; previously we removed styles immediately upon unmount of any instance without checking how many copies were still alive, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup) (see [#1989](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1989))

## [v4.0.0-beta.1] - 2018-09-06

- Fixed an issue where `createGlobalStyle` was clobbering the very next style to be applied during rehydration in production mode, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup) (see [#1976](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1976))

- Removed some unused code, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup) (see [#1976](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1976))

- Switched `createGlobalStyle` to be a `PureComponent`, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup) (see [#1976](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1976))

## [v4.0.0-beta.0] - 2018-09-04

- Remove deprecated `consolidateStreamedStyles` API, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup) (see [#1906](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1906))

- Remove deprecated `jsnext:main` entry point from package.json, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup) (see [#1907](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1907))

- Remove deprecated `.extend` API, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup) (see [#1908](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1908))

- Migrate to new context API, by [@alexandernanberg](https://github.com/alexandernanberg) (see [#1894](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1894))

- Remove TS typings; they are now to be found in DefinitelyTyped, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup). See https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/issues/1778 for more information.

- Add new `data-styled-version` attribute to generated `<style>` tags to allow multiple versions of styled-components to function on the page at once without clobbering each other, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup)

  It's still highly recommended to use aliasing via your bundler to dedupe libraries like styled-components and react.

- [Breaking change] Refactor `keyframes` helper, by [@fer0x](https://github.com/Fer0x) (see [#1930](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1930)).

  Keyframes is now implemented in a "lazy" manner: its styles will be injected with the render phase of components using them.

  `keyframes` no longer returns an animation name, instead it returns an object which has method `.getName()` for the purpose of getting the animation name.

* Add `createGlobalStyle` that returns a component which, when mounting, will apply global styles. This is a replacement for the `injectGlobal` API. It can be updated, replaced, removed, etc like any normal component and the global scope will update accordingly, by [@JamieDixon](https://github.com/JamieDixon) [@marionebl](https://github.com/marionebl), [@yjimk](https://github.com/yjimk), and [@imbhargav5](https://github.com/imbhargav5) (see [#1416](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1416))

  ```jsx
  const GlobalStyles = createGlobalStyle`
    html {
      color: 'red';
    }
  `;

  // then put it in your React tree somewhere:
  // <GlobalStyles />
  ```

- Migrate to use new `React.forwardRef` API, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup); note that this removes the `innerRef` API since it is no longer needed.

- Implement `styled()` wrapper folding. In a nutshell, when you nest styled wrappers (e.g. `styled(styled.div)`) the components are now folded such that only one is mounted that contains the merged styles of its ancestors. This is conceptually equivalent to the removed "extend" functionality, but without many of the downsides -- and it's automatic, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup) (see [#1962](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1962))

- Added a first-class API for rendering polymorphism via "as" prop. In most cases, this new prop will replace your need to use the `.withComponent` API. It allows you to control what underlying element or component is rendered at runtime, while not messing with the styles, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup) (see [#1962](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1962))

  ```jsx
  import { Link } from 'react-router'

  const Component = styled.div`
    color: red;
  `

  // Examples
  <Component>Hello world!</Component>
  <Component as="span">Hello world!</Component>
  <Component as={Link} to="home">Hello world!</Component>
  ```

- Add `StyleSheet.remove` API method to be able to delete rules related to a component (see [#1514](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1514))

- Replace murmurhash implementation and avoid destructuring tag function arguments (see [#1516](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1516))

- Use much faster CSS injection in the browser, by [@schwers](https://github.com/schwers) and [@philpl](https://github.com/philpl) (see [#1208](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1208))
- Add support for streaming server-side rendering, by [@probablyup](https://github.com/probablyup) (see [#1430](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1430))

## [v3.0.2] - 2018-01-22

- Add secret internals for jest-styled-components (do not use or you will be haunted by spooky ghosts :ghost:) (see [#1438](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1438))

## [v3.0.1] - 2018-01-22

- Fixed bug where `innerRef` could be passed as undefined to components when using withTheme. This could cause issues when using prop spread within the component (e.g. `{...this.props}`), because React will still warn you about using a non-dom prop even though it's undefined. (see [#1414](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1414))

(see [#1418](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/1418/))
