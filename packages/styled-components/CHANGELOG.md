## 6.3.6

### Patch Changes

- 189bc17: Fix url() CSS function values being incorrectly stripped when using unquoted URLs containing `//` (e.g., `url(https://example.com)`). The `//` in protocol URLs like `https://`, `http://`, `file://`, and protocol-relative URLs was incorrectly being treated as a JavaScript-style line comment.

## 6.3.5

### Patch Changes

- 7ff7002: Fix: Line comments (`//`) in multiline CSS declarations no longer cause parsing errors (fixes #5613)

  JS-style line comments (`//`) placed after multiline declarations like `calc()` were not being properly stripped, causing CSS parsing issues. Comments are now correctly removed anywhere in the CSS while preserving valid syntax.

  **Example that now works:**

  ```tsx
  const Box = styled.div`
    max-height: calc(100px + 200px + 300px); // This comment no longer breaks parsing
    background-color: green;
  `;
  ```

- 7ff7002: Fix: Contain invalid CSS syntax to just the affected line

  In styled-components v6, invalid CSS syntax (like unbalanced braces) could cause all subsequent styles to be ignored. This fix ensures that malformed CSS only affects the specific declaration, not subsequent valid styles.

  **Example that now works:**

  ```tsx
  const Circle = styled.div`
    width: 100px;
    line-height: ${() => '14px}'}; // ⛔️ This malformed line is dropped
    background-color: green; // ✅ Now preserved (was ignored in v6)
  `;
  ```

## 6.3.4

### Patch Changes

- 8e8c282: Fixed `createGlobalStyle` to not use `useLayoutEffect` on the server, which was causing a warning and broken styles in v6.3.x. The check `typeof React.useLayoutEffect === 'function'` is not reliable for detecting server vs client environments in React 18+, so we now use the `__SERVER__` build constant instead.

## 6.3.3

### Patch Changes

- 6e4d1e7: fix: suppress false "created dynamically" warnings in React Server Components

  The dynamic creation warning check now properly detects RSC environments and skips validation when `IS_RSC` is true. This eliminates false warnings for module-level styled components in server components, which were incorrectly flagged due to RSC's different module evaluation context. Module-level styled components in RSC files no longer trigger warnings since they cannot be created inside render functions by definition.

## 6.3.2

### Patch Changes

- a4b4a6b: fix: include TypeScript declaration files in npm package

  Fixed Rollup TypeScript plugin configuration to override tsconfig.json's noEmit setting, ensuring TypeScript declaration files are generated during build.

- a4b4a6b: fix: resolve TypeScript error blocking type declaration emission

  Fixed TypeScript error in StyledComponent when merging style attributes from attrs. Added explicit type cast to React.CSSProperties to safely merge CSS property objects. This error was preventing TypeScript declaration files from being generated during build.

## 6.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 046e880: Ensure TypeScript declaration files are included in npm package, needed to tweak a Rollup setting.

## 6.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 28fd502: Add React Server Components (RSC) support

  styled-components now automatically detects RSC environments and handles CSS delivery appropriately:

  - **No `'use client'` directive required**: Components work in RSC without any wrapper or directive
  - **Automatic CSS injection**: In RSC mode, styled components emit inline `<style>` tags that React 19 automatically hoists and deduplicates
  - **Zero configuration**: Works out of the box with Next.js App Router and other RSC-enabled frameworks
  - **Backward compatible**: Existing SSR patterns with `ServerStyleSheet` continue to work unchanged

  RSC best practices:

  - Prefer static styles over dynamic interpolations to avoid serialization overhead
  - Use data attributes for discrete variants (e.g., `&[data-size='lg']`)
  - CSS custom properties work perfectly in styled-components, can be set via inline `style`, and cascade to children:

  ```tsx
  const Container = styled.div``;
  const Button = styled.button`
    background: var(--color-primary, blue);
  `;

  // Variables set on parent cascade to all DOM children
  <Container style={{ '--color-primary': 'orchid' }}>
    <Button>Inherits orchid background</Button>
  </Container>;
  ```

  - Use build-time CSS variable generation for theming since `ThemeProvider` is a no-op in RSC

  Technical details:

  - RSC detection via `typeof React.createContext === 'undefined'`
  - `ThemeProvider` and `StyleSheetManager` become no-ops in RSC (children pass-through)
  - React hooks are conditionally accessed via runtime guards
  - CSS is retrieved from the StyleSheet Tag for inline delivery in RSC mode

- 856cf06: feat: update built-in element aliases to include modern HTML and SVG elements

  Added support for modern HTML and SVG elements that were previously missing:

  HTML elements:

  - `search` - HTML5 search element
  - `slot` - Web Components slot element
  - `template` - HTML template element

  SVG filter elements:

  - All `fe*` filter primitive elements (feBlend, feColorMatrix, feComponentTransfer, etc.)
  - `clipPath`, `linearGradient`, `radialGradient` - gradient and clipping elements
  - `textPath` - SVG text path element
  - `switch`, `symbol`, `use` - SVG structural elements

  This ensures styled-components has comprehensive coverage of all styleable HTML and SVG elements supported by modern browsers and React.

### Patch Changes

- 418adbe: fix(types): add CSS custom properties (variables) support to style prop

  CSS custom properties (CSS variables like `--primary-color`) are now fully supported in TypeScript without errors:

  - `.attrs({ style: { '--var': 'value' } })` - CSS variables in attrs
  - `<Component style={{ '--var': 'value' }} />` - CSS variables in component props
  - Mixed usage with regular CSS properties works seamlessly

- aef2ad6: Update shared css property handling tools to latest versions.

## 6.2.0

### Patch Changes

- d0b73ac: Fix no longer existing link in console debug message
- 8a9c21b: Upgrade stylis to 4.3.6. [Related commits](https://github.com/thysultan/stylis/commits/master/?since=2024-08-01&until=2025-09-11)

- c3a5990: Update csstype dependency from 3.1.3 to 3.2.3

  This updates the pinned csstype dependency from 3.1.3 to 3.2.3 to fix a
  type incompatibility with @types/react.

## 6.1.19

### Patch Changes

- aa997d8: fix for React Native >=0.79 crashes when using unsupported web-only CSS values (e.g., fit-content, min-content, max-content). The fix emits a warning and ignores the property using those values, instead of causing crashes.
