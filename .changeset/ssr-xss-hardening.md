"styled-components": patch
---

Server-side output escapes `</style>` substrings (rewritten as the CSS hex escape `\3C/style`, which the CSS engine still parses identically) and HTML-escapes nonce values before they reach the rendered `<style ...>` tag, so user-supplied content interpolated into styles can't break out and inject markup. In-browser style injection is unaffected.
